Under Sky
=========

Minetest mod which adds a black skybox at height -100 to prevent the default skybox (and sun) showing through the walls of caves which have not fully loaded. This improves atmosphere and makes caves as dark as caves should be.


Settings
--------

If you wish to change the height below which the black skybox appears, adjust the value of sky_start, on line 2 of the init.lua file.
